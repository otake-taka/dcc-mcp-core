# DCC-MCP Creator

Use this skill when you are creating a new DCC-MCP adapter, modernizing an
existing adapter repository, or exposing a private non-DCC studio system as a
standalone MCP service: server composition, host-thread dispatch,
sidecar/gateway wiring, readiness, resources, project state, diagnostics,
install lifecycle, or cross-DCC verification. A local folder, intranet source
tree, or private monorepo is sufficient; GitHub is not a runtime requirement.

For individual skill packages (`SKILL.md`, `tools.yaml`, scripts, groups, and
skill taxonomy), load `dcc-mcp-skills-creator` instead.

## Install and Route

Install the published
[`@loonghao/dcc-mcp-creator`](https://clawhub.ai/loonghao/skills/dcc-mcp-creator)
package, then start a new agent turn:

```bash
openclaw skills install @loonghao/dcc-mcp-creator
npx --yes clawhub@0.23.1 install @loonghao/dcc-mcp-creator
```

Use [`dcc-mcp`](https://clawhub.ai/loonghao/skills/dcc-mcp) to operate an
existing DCC. Use
[`dcc-mcp-skills-creator`](https://clawhub.ai/loonghao/skills/dcc-mcp-skills-creator)
when only a DCC-specific Skill package is needed.

## CLI-First Control Path

Use the `dcc-mcp` skill and `dcc-mcp-cli` for discovery, validation, and live
DCC control whenever the agent can run shell commands. If the CLI is missing,
follow the consent-gated official installation instructions in `dcc-mcp`.
Before long-lived validation, run `dcc-mcp-cli update check`; use
`dcc-mcp-cli update apply` to verify and stage the latest CLI for the next
launch. Apply-time verification is installation-bound and legacy unsigned
staging is quarantined. Official update manifests additionally require the
release workflow's detached Sigstore provenance. This does not replace a running server binary; update
the server from its exact target environment. Gateway Admin is check-only.

## Runtime Vocabulary

- DCC startup hook: adapter code running inside the host at application startup; it prepares env/instance data and launches the service path without blocking the DCC UI/main thread.
- Per-DCC service: one registered runtime row for one concrete DCC instance; Python `DccServerBase` and Rust sidecars both participate as per-DCC services.
- Sidecar: the Rust `dcc-mcp-sidecar` child launched through the stable `dcc-mcp-server sidecar` command; it bridges host RPC to MCP/REST and exits when the watched DCC dies.
- Gateway daemon: the one machine-wide `dcc-mcp-server gateway` process that owns routing, dynamic capability search/describe/call, and Gateway Admin.
- Guardian: a lightweight loop inside daemon-backed services that probes gateway `/health` and re-ensures the daemon through `gateway-launch.lock`; it is not a separate process.
- Service heartbeat: registry freshness for the service row only. Do not describe heartbeat as the gateway restart trigger.
- Service owner: the process that owns the registry sentinel and MCP endpoint; its `pid`/sentinel prove the service itself is alive.
- Bound DCC host: optional external process identified by `host_pid`; both owner and host must stay alive. Standalone/headless services intentionally have no bound host.

## Fast Workflow

1. Classify the ownership boundary before creating files:
   - Public DCC adapter: run `dcc-mcp-cli dcc-types`; improve an existing
     adapter instead of creating a duplicate. Add a genuinely new public
     adapter to `dcc-mcp-catalog.yml` and the compatibility matrix. A pip
     install entry requires the released universal wheel's exact HTTPS URL,
     catalog version, and SHA-256; omit install metadata until it is published.
   - Private non-DCC service: work in the supplied local or intranet project,
     keep its stable custom service id private, and do not require a GitHub
     repository, public catalog entry, issue, or release. Use a studio-owned
     catalog only when operators need `dcc-mcp-cli install` plans.
   - Skill package only: switch to `dcc-mcp-skills-creator`.
2. Classify the runtime integration:
   - Embedded Python host: Blender, 3ds Max Python, Houdini, Maya, Nuke.
   - External bridge host: ZBrush, Photoshop, Unity, custom tools.
   - Game/editor host with mixed Python or C++ bridge: Unreal, Unity.
   - Standalone internal service: no host bridge; use inline execution for
     ordinary service/file/API tools and keep every tool typed.
3. Read the relevant reference:
   - [ADAPTER_WORKFLOW.md](references/ADAPTER_WORKFLOW.md) for the build path.
   - [INTERNAL_SERVICE_WORKFLOW.md](references/INTERNAL_SERVICE_WORKFLOW.md) for a private non-DCC service with no public repository requirement.
   - [HOST_PATTERN_MATRIX.md](references/HOST_PATTERN_MATRIX.md) for host-specific wiring.
   - [CORE_ESCALATION_CHECKLIST.md](references/CORE_ESCALATION_CHECKLIST.md) before adding adapter-local glue.
    - [TESTING_AND_RELEASE.md](references/TESTING_AND_RELEASE.md) before validating or publishing.
    - **Python 3.7 policy**: native py37 is an LTS profile with no automatic calendar expiry. Verify the aggregate Python 3.7 gate is green and `requires-python = ">=3.7"` is unchanged before any release. `py37-lite` fallback does NOT satisfy release gates. Removal requires an accepted superseding ADR, a major release, and at least 180 days of notice.
    - [docs/guide/gateway.md](../../docs/guide/gateway.md) for gateway daemon lifecycle details.
    - [docs/guide/adapter-install-lifecycle.md](../../docs/guide/adapter-install-lifecycle.md) for sidecar launch/readiness details.
    - [docs/guide/adapter-release-checklist.md](../../docs/guide/adapter-release-checklist.md) for release train compliance.
    - [docs/guide/new-adapter-onboarding.md](../../docs/guide/new-adapter-onboarding.md) for new adapter scaffolding.
    - [docs/guide/adapter-compatibility-matrix.md](../../docs/guide/adapter-compatibility-matrix.md) for the per-DCC compatibility table.
4. Start from `DccServerBase` + `DccServerOptions.from_env(...)`.
   Classify the runtime lifetime explicitly:
   - Embedded adapter: the service owner is the DCC process; no separate host PID is needed.
   - Standard sidecar: pass `watch_pid=current_dcc_pid`; core publishes the sidecar owner and bound host as separate liveness signals.
   - Other out-of-process adapter: pass `dcc_pid=current_dcc_pid` so `McpHttpConfig.host_pid` binds discovery to the DCC lifetime.
   - Standalone/headless service: pass `instance_type="standalone"`, leave `dcc_pid` unset, and do not bind it to an optional GUI process. Runtime identity is independent from `standalone_main_thread`, which controls tool execution only.
5. Route host API calls through `HostExecutionBridge`; do not hand-roll a second script executor. Standalone services with no host-thread boundary should keep the default inline execution path.
6. Keep service identity data-driven: `dcc_name`/custom service id, `server_name`, env-var prefix, skill names, and gateway metadata.
   Leave the instance port unset so core resolves `DCC_MCP_<DCC>_PORT` or asks the OS for a free port.
7. Use core helpers for skill discovery, `MinimalModeConfig`, project tools, resources, diagnostics, context snapshots, install lifecycle, and gateway failover before writing adapter-local wrappers. Python `DccServerBase.collect_skill_search_paths()` includes marketplace-installed skills under `~/.dcc-mcp/marketplace/<dcc>` (or `DCC_MCP_MARKETPLACE_INSTALL_ROOT/<dcc>`) when the directory exists, so adapters should not add a second marketplace path convention. Hermetic adapter tests should set `DCC_MCP_DISABLE_DEFAULT_SKILL_PATHS=1`; this excludes implicit local/platform defaults, marketplace installs, and Admin custom paths while explicit, bundled, and environment-provided skill paths remain active.
   `DccServerBase` also owns `DiagnosticRuntimeState`; do not add adapter-level
   recorder, sandbox, screenshot-capturer, dispatcher, server, or instance-context
   globals. Standalone registration code may inject one state into both
   diagnostic registration helpers.
   It also owns `feedback_store`, `script_execution_context`, and
   `checkpoint_store`; inject them into core helpers instead of creating
   adapter-level feedback buffers, persistent exec namespaces, or default stores.
   - For native visual UI fallback, reuse the bundled `ui-control` skill with
     standalone `dcc-cua` 0.4.0 or newer; do not add adapter-local capture,
     accessibility, or raw-input wrappers. Keep stateful UI calls in one
     long-lived adapter process so each logical session retains its persistent
     CUA bridge and window capability. Preserve `capture_provenance` with
     evidence. The shared CUA Host owns platform accessibility, capture,
     banner/border/cursor markers, Escape interruption, input serialization,
     and recording. `ui-control` remains `requires_in_process: true` with
     `affinity: any`; register `HostExecutionBridge` before skill loading.
   - Keep structured DCC skills, host APIs, and adapter scripts ahead of
     `ui-control`. Agents should make an explicit, agent-directed transition into the scoped
     `snapshot` → one `act` → `snapshot` loop only when an operation is
     unsupported, no suitable tool exists, or semantic UI Automation cannot
     reach the required control. Re-observe after every action.
   - Raw pointer and keyboard input are enabled by default only inside the
     adapter/operator-bound DCC scope. Operators may set
     `DCC_MCP_CUA_ALLOW_RAW_INPUT=false` to disable that runtime ceiling; the
     adapter must not override this choice. Before raw input can start, the
     adapter/operator must set `DCC_MCP_UI_CONTROL_PROCESS_ID` or
     `DCC_MCP_UI_CONTROL_WINDOW_HANDLE` to
      the adapter's own DCC target; request scope may only narrow that trusted
      PID/HWND. Require a visible unlocked desktop and matching Windows
      integrity level, preserve the click-through border/banner/pointer feedback, and preserve
      `user_interrupted` without automatic retry, `session_id` changes, or fallback. Once Esc stops an
      session, only `ui_control__snapshot(resume_computer_use=true)` may request a
      resume, and the isolated host must still obtain trusted user confirmation
      before clearing the latch. Always call `ui_control__stop_computer_use` when
      the workflow ends.
      Never transition or retry through another UI/input path after a policy,
      authorization, authentication, security, confirmation,
      `desktop_unavailable`, or `user_interrupted` result.
      Keep mutating UI Control tools annotated as destructive. The optional
      `intent` may only raise the native host's independent UIA/input
      classification. Do not introduce a model-supplied `confirmed`/`approved`
      flag or environment bypass.
8. Use CLI profiles (`dcc-mcp-cli gateway ...`, `list/search/describe/call`) as the user UX; treat `dcc-mcp-server` modes as runtime plumbing. Read `docs/guide/gateway.md` before changing daemon, guardian, sentinel, registry, or idle-timeout behavior.
   Gateway discovery reuses a recent capability snapshot across adjacent
   queries. Route adapter catalog changes through the existing
   load/reload/unload contracts that force a refresh; never depend on every
   search polling the full backend catalog.
   `gateway://instances` is agent-safe by default and returns only live,
   routable rows. Use `?include_stale=true`, `?include_dead=true`, or
   `?view=all` only for explicit diagnosis; never route a call from those
   expanded operator views without re-validating live readiness.
   Once an instance is selected, reuse `gateway://instances/{instance_id}` or
   `GET /v1/instances/{instance_id}/context` for live process/machine
   performance, scene/documents, loaded skills, and canonical follow-up routes.
   These reads fetch the backend context on demand, but scene freshness remains
   adapter-owned: publish changes from a host event/main-thread callback with
   `DccServerBase.update_gateway_metadata(...)`, and publish rich snapshots with
   `set_scene_resource(...)`. Never claim scene awareness when the adapter has
   not installed a publisher; `scene=null` / `no_scene_published` is explicit.
   For agent observability, read `gateway://experiments/{experiment_id}` for
   runs, Session DAG links, metrics, and Judge evidence; read
   `gateway://governance` for the effective policy boundary. Keep Admin memory
   deletion controls out of agent-readable resources.
9. Use `dcc_mcp_core.deployment.build_sidecar_command(...)` / `launch_sidecar(...)` for library-driven sidecar startup and readiness. Installer subprocesses should use `dcc-mcp-install-lifecycle`; `dcc_mcp_core.install_lifecycle` and `python -m dcc_mcp_core.install_lifecycle` remain compatibility aliases. Read `docs/guide/adapter-install-lifecycle.md` before changing host RPC, dispatch readiness, launch stdio, `watch_pid`, or `instance_id` handling.
   - The sidecar MCP listener is dispatch-only. A py37-lite factory can expose local skill metadata, but it cannot advertise or activate declarative skills through the gateway. Require a native py37 wheel for that path, or provide a separate discovery MCP URL; never report lite `load_skill` success without an executable catalog.
   - Wrap the outer adapter import/start block with `capture_bootstrap_errors(...)`; it is stdlib-only, records pre-MCP failures, and re-raises for the DCC's native error UI. `DccServerBase` already captures Python error logs and uncaught exceptions into the shared log plus `output://` / `events://`. Forward host-native console callbacks with `server.report_host_error(...)`; do not replace global stdout/stderr or add an adapter-local error store.
   - For DCC-Link IPC upgrades, deploy readers that accept current version 1 and legacy version 0 before switching writers to the default versioned frame. Use `DccLinkFrame(..., version=0)` only during that compatibility window, preserve an incoming frame's version in its reply, and treat `unsupported DCC-Link protocol version` as an explicit peer-upgrade failure rather than retrying body decoding.
   - Registry producers must write `ServiceEntry.schema_version` using `SERVICE_ENTRY_SCHEMA_VERSION`; rows with no field are legacy version 0. Consumers may read legacy/current rows but must reject a higher schema version without quarantining, deleting, or rewriting `services.json`. Treat that error as an explicit peer-upgrade requirement, not as corrupt JSON.
10. Pass `instance_id` to sidecar launch helpers only when it is a real UUID for the DCC service. During early startup, omit it or pass `None`; `build_sidecar_command()` rejects cosmetic values such as `"unknown"` with `success=false` and `reason="invalid_instance_id"` so adapters do not spawn a child that can only fail with a CLI argument error.
    After `DccServerBase.start()`, use `server.instance_id` when adapter UI or
    sidecar wiring needs the canonical FileRegistry identity. It is the exact
    registered UUID and is `None` before start, after stop, or when gateway
    registration is disabled/unavailable; never inspect private handles or
    generate a replacement UUID.
11. Adapter supervisors that must stop the sidecar on plugin unload should call `launch_sidecar(..., return_process=True, detached=False)` instead of reimplementing `subprocess.Popen`; keep `return_process=False` for CLI/JSON paths because the process handle is not serializable.
12. If the adapter cannot share the gateway `FileRegistry`, register remotely through `POST /v1/instances/register`, refresh with `/heartbeat`, and deregister on shutdown; the gateway will expose the row as `source: "http"` in `gateway://instances` / `GET /v1/instances`, preserve `instance_short` and `mcp_url`, and route it through the same `live_instances` contract.
    The core daemon can require its single `--auth-token-file` bearer, and remote CLI profiles can send a bearer read from their stored token-file path. The remote HTTP adapter-registration credential producer is still an exact implementation gap: do not call authenticated HTTP registration operational or qualified until an adapter-owned producer reads and sends its separately scoped credential. Gateway call credentials and future registration credentials remain separate; never forward, log, or repurpose either as a backend credential.
    Managed gateway start/ensure compares requested auth mode with public `auth_enabled` before accepting a resident; only legacy-unknown plus no-auth preserves compatibility. Managed restart validates the replacement token file before stop. Keep status/readback tri-state and secret-free.
13. Keep the gateway's secondary listener on its default loopback host. Opt into LAN access only with an explicit `--remote-host 0.0.0.0` or concrete LAN IP; for same-LAN convenience discovery, build with `mdns` and pair adapter-side `--advertise-mdns` with gateway-side `--discover-mdns`. Treat mDNS as a multicast discovery hint only, keep auth/TLS policy explicit, and prefer HTTP registration or relay for routed/subnet-crossing production deployments.
14. For NAT or routed-subnet deployments, run the tunnel agent with stable `instance_id`, `capabilities_fingerprint`, `adapter_version`, and `scene` metadata, then configure the standalone gateway with `--relay-source ADMIN_URL=PUBLIC_BASE_URL`; the gateway will expose active tunnels as `source: "relay"` rows with relay details in `source_meta` after probing `/v1/healthz` through `<PUBLIC_BASE_URL>/tunnel/<tunnel_id>/mcp`.
15. Preserve gateway caller attribution when adding adapter wrappers or admin/debug routes: let MCP `initialize.params.clientInfo`, MCP `_meta.agent_context`, REST `meta.agent_context`, `x-dcc-mcp-*` headers, and safe `User-Agent` fallbacks flow through core rather than logging raw prompts or local machine data.
16. For lifecycle/memory/telemetry policy, use `register_lifecycle_hooks(...)`, `search_skills(..., session_id=...)`, `dispatch_session_start(...)`, `dispatch_before_tool_call(...)`, `dispatch_after_tool_call(...)`, and `dispatch_session_end(...)`; pair `MemoryRecorder(InMemoryMemoryStore()).install(hooks)` with those hooks when adapters need bounded memory summaries, failed-pattern avoidance, or session compaction. Memory injection is conservative and budgeted by default: search receives compact ranking hints, tool calls receive memory only when it matches the current `tool_name`, and session-start injection is opt-in. Use `SqliteMemoryStore()` only when longterm patterns should be durable, operator-managed in the Admin Memory tab, and included in memory hit-rate observability; disable the recorder for privacy-sensitive deployments. Open a focused core issue/RFC only when those public hooks cannot express the adapter boundary.
17. Add one executable smoke path: unit tests for construction plus either headless DCC, mock dispatcher MCP calls, gateway REST replay, mDNS same-LAN discovery smoke, relay-source smoke, the open-source MCP Inspector for a loopback internal service, or `just idle-memory-smoke` for standalone server idle/regression checks.
18. For gateway/admin observability, surface explicit state instead of silent zeroes: traffic panels should report disabled, unavailable, filtered, or genuine no-traffic states; skill panels should distinguish discovered, loaded, searched, selected, called, failed, and low-adoption skills; and admin-facing frames/paths should stay metadata-only or aliased unless an operator explicitly configures a private raw sink. Keep `ServiceEntry.version` as the DCC application version; use core-published `dcc_mcp_server_version` and `dcc_mcp_instance_type=gui|standalone` metadata for server regression and runtime-shape diagnostics instead of overloading DCC or adapter versions.
19. Preserve workflow observability: adapter calls should carry request, parent, trace, session, DCC, transport, and artifact/validation metadata so the Admin workflow graph can show Intent → Discovery → Skill Load → Tool Calls → Fallbacks → Artifacts → Validation → Report without raw log reading.
20. Preserve bounded `agent_context` task/session/turn metadata and artifact/validation-friendly tool names so Admin task outcomes can group workflows, calls, deliverables, and checks without reading raw payloads or local paths.
21. Preserve record-replay ownership boundaries: forward server-derived
    `agent_context.session_id`, keep UI Control logical ids connection/caller
    scoped, and write only redacted recording projections to existing
    `session_events`. Do not add adapter-local recorder state, a second
    database, or a replay authority flag. Persist calls incrementally; after a
    gateway restart, project unfinished recordings as `interrupted` without
    restoring capture authority. Generated workflows re-resolve current tools
    and schemas; semantic UI replay resolves fresh control ids; raw/visual
    fallback requires exact-window calibration and drift guards.
22. Record reproducible experiment definitions, run states, Session DAG links,
    metrics, and judge evidence through the gateway `/v1/experiments` APIs.
    Reuse `session_events`, workflow/recording identifiers, and artifact
    references; do not add adapter-local experiment storage or treat judge
    output as approval authority.

## Chunked Main-Thread Jobs

Use the shared chunked path when a main-affinity operation cannot finish within
one host UI tick. The adapter owns scheduling; skill code only defines bounded
steps:

```python
from dcc_mcp_core import chunked_job

@chunked_job(total=100)
def bake_frames():
    for frame in range(100):
        yield lambda frame=frame: bake_one_frame(frame)

# A declarative in-process tool returns this runner. HostExecutionBridge
# detects and submits it to HostUiDispatcherBase automatically.
return bake_frames()
```

- Declare `execution: async`, `affinity: main`, and
  `job_strategy: chunked`. The bridge rejects a declared chunked tool that
  returns a monolithic value.
- Yield one bounded host-API callable per step. A returned string becomes the
  progress message.
- `submit_chunked_runner()` advances at most one step per host pump tick, so
  unrelated UI work can run between steps.
- `cancel(request_id)` requests cancellation. The runner publishes
  `cancelled` only after the next checkpoint observes it; a running native DCC
  call or monolithic callback is not pre-empted.
- Do not add adapter-local generator pumps, timer loops, worker threads, or a
  second job registry.
- Test pending cancellation, cancellation during a step, monotonic progress,
  failure, exactly one terminal result, unrelated pump work, and at least two
  host labels.

Do not label an indivisible native call as chunked. Use
`job_strategy: monolithic` when the host API cannot yield, or
`job_strategy: isolated` when a process/service-owned operation can return a
durable job id. Isolated status must remain queryable after transport loss;
cancellation may remain process-owner scoped when reconstructing ownership
would be unsafe.

## Liveness and Crash Recovery

- Keep registry heartbeat and HTTP readiness independent of the DCC main
  thread. A readiness/transport timeout marks the instance `unreachable`; it
  must not erase a row whose owner lock/PID or remote TTL is still valid.
- Keep HTTP body limits, trusted-proxy depth, and request-rate windows on the
  owning `GatewayState` (`GatewayIngressState`). Embedded adapters may host
  more than one gateway in a process, so process-global lazy counters or env
  snapshots are not a valid isolation boundary.
- Keep backend retry policy and circuit observations on the same owning
  `GatewayState` through `GatewayResilienceState`. Pass that state through
  backend discovery and dispatch calls; never use a process-global circuit
  table, because one embedded gateway must not open another gateway's backend.
- Pass the complete `McpHttpConfig.features` snapshot into HTTP runtime state
  with `ServerStateBuilder::with_features`. Do not copy capability booleans
  into loose `ServerState` fields; config and runtime routing must read the
  same `FeatureFlags` source.
- In Rust async gateway/adapter code, share `Arc<FileRegistry>` directly and
  call its `*_async` methods. `FileRegistry` is already internally synchronized;
  an outer `RwLock` adds no safety and holding an async guard across its
  flock/fsync transaction blocks the runtime.
- Treat owner lock/PID death or remote TTL expiry as crash evidence. After a
  crash, the adapter cannot reconnect until the DCC or sidecar starts again.
- Preserve stable `dcc_type`, scene/project metadata, and adapter identity so
  agents can rediscover a replacement instance. Never reuse an old tool slug
  or direct MCP URL after the instance id changes.
- Enable core job persistence. On restart, in-flight core jobs become
  `interrupted` and remain queryable through the replacement instance's
  `jobs_get_status`; adapter-owned isolated jobs need their own durable status
  tool when they outlive the request transport. If the worker can outlive the
  DCC/sidecar process, that status tool must be owned by the worker/service or
  another independently live control process; gateway restart alone cannot
  recreate an API whose owner exited.

## Failure Analysis and Bug Routing

Reproduce through `dcc-mcp` and keep one gateway session id. Run
`dcc-mcp-cli doctor`, then `dcc-mcp-cli stats --status failure --session-id
<session-id>`; preserve the failed call's `request_id`, trace/job ids, adapter
version, DCC version, readiness fields, and the smallest safe reproduction.
Use `/v1/debug/issue-reports/<request_id>` for the public-safe issue body and
review any `?mode=raw` export locally before sharing it.

Report adapter-owned dispatch, host-thread, readiness, packaging, or install
bugs in the adapter repository. Escalate shared CLI, gateway, protocol, or core
contract failures to `dcc-mcp-core`. Tool schema/script/workflow defects belong
to the owning Skill and `dcc-mcp-skills-creator`. Record runtime feedback with
the CLI-discovered `dcc_feedback__report` tool; open an external issue only
with user authorization.

## Example: New Nuke Adapter

When asked to create a Nuke MCP adapter, start by mapping the host lifecycle:
how Python is loaded, how the UI/main thread must be entered, what headless
mode is available, how plugins are installed, and which operations should be
bundled as default skills. Then scaffold the adapter around core primitives:

- `DccServerBase` for MCP/HTTP and skill catalog behavior.
- `DccServerOptions.from_env("NUKE")` or an adapter-specific equivalent for env-driven configuration.
- `HostExecutionBridge` plus a Nuke dispatcher for all Nuke API calls.
- Core project, readiness, resource, diagnostics, and gateway helpers before adapter-local glue.
- `dcc-mcp-skills-creator` for the first `nuke-*` skill packages.

## Example: Private Non-DCC Service

When asked to expose an internal asset, render-farm, review, or production
service, stay in the supplied private project and start with
[`examples/remote-server`](../../examples/remote-server). It is a standalone
service despite the historical directory name: it binds to loopback for local
development, discovers a bundled example Skill, and needs no DCC process or GitHub
repository.

- Use a stable custom identifier such as `studio-assets`; do not pretend it is
  Maya or another cataloged DCC.
- Pass `instance_type="standalone"`, leave `dcc_pid` unset, and use inline
  execution unless a real external host boundary exists.
- Validate the Skill, start the service, then exercise `tools/list`,
  `tools/call`, resources, and errors with the official open-source MCP
  Inspector before testing gateway discovery.
- Keep development on loopback. Intranet exposure requires operator-owned
  TLS, authentication, firewall policy, secret storage, and audit controls.
- Package through the owner's existing wheel, archive, container, Rez, or
  private registry workflow. Do not create or publish a public repository
  unless the user explicitly requests it.

## Cross-DCC Asset Sync

When an adapter publishes an evolving file to another local or remote DCC, use
Core's `AssetSyncRevision` and `FileAssetSyncStore` contract. Keep absolute
paths process-local: public tools accept a relative source name, while both the
source root and consumer destination root come from operator configuration.
Validate format and size before publishing, pass `expected_head_revision` for
optimistic conflict detection, and materialize only beneath the consumer-owned
root. The adapter owns its native import, canvas, refresh, or watch behavior;
Core owns only the path-free revision manifest, content-addressed object, and
conflict/materialization rules. See `docs/guide/asset-sync.md` and ADR-021.

## Non-Negotiables

- Do not touch a DCC API from a Tokio/HTTP worker thread.
- Do not parse or rewrite `SKILL.md`, `tools.yaml`, `groups.yaml`, or prompt/workflow files in adapter runtime code when core exposes a typed object or catalog API.
- Do not reach into `server._server` unless no public core API exists; if you must, file a core issue and keep the adapter shim small.
- Do not create Maya-only abstractions in shared core or adapter templates.
- Do not expose raw script execution as the primary user workflow when a typed skill can cover the task.
- Do not require GitHub, a public catalog entry, or public issue tracking for a private internal service.
- Do not publish local paths, private machine names, or source-attribution markers in public issues or PR text.
